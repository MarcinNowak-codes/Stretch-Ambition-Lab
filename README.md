# Java Sandbox
##Play with Java features and have fun!

In 2021 my Stretch Ambition is to learn about new feature in Java 9-15. 
One of the best ways to remember something is to use it. 

Not so mach at this moment, but I'm happy that I started this journey.

Some of my test you can find:

- [JEP 254: Compact Strings](JEP254-Compact_Strings)
- JEP 110: HTTP/2 Client - coming soon
