# Stretch Ambition
## Play with Java features and have fun!

In 2021 my Stretch Ambition is to learn about new feature in Java 9-15. 
One of the best ways to remember something is to use it. 

Not so mach at this moment, but I'm happy that I started this journey.

Some of my test you can find:

- [JEP 254: Compact Strings](Java-9-JEP254-Compact_Strings)
- [JEP 110: HTTP/2 Client](Java-9-JEP110-HTTP2_Client)

## Postgres new cool staff

- [Access Method](PostgreSQL-10-ACCESS_METHOD)
- [Table Partitioning](PostgreSQL-10-Table_Partitioning)
- [CREATE PROCEDURE](PostgreSQL-11-CREATE_PROCEDURE)
- [pg_verifybackup](PostgreSQL-13-pg_verifybackup)
